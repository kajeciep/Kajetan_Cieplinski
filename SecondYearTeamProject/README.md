# Second Year Team Project 

This team project was done in my second year of University, in a group of 6. We made a game similar to the 2D "Worms" games.
My role was chiefly developing the UI for the game, and most of the code in the 'com.game.UI' package is my work, however I
also worked on parts of the renderer and game controller.

## Requirements

The program requires 'JavaFX' in order to run, since the UI is dependent on it. Otherwise, only a 'jdk-14.0.1' and 'JUnit 5'
is needed.
